This project represents an ongoing learning journey, acknowledging its current state while highlighting the valuable insights gained along the way.

### Tools:
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/get_started/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
- [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat)

### Concepts:
- [LLM Parameters](https://cohere.com/blog/llm-parameters-best-outputs-language-ai)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ([Basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIWbhwLyDQQ) and [Advanced](https://medium.com/@thakermadhav/build-your-own-rag-with-mistral-7b-and-langchain-97d0c92fa146))
- Vector Stores ([Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/vector-database/))
- Embeddings ([LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/))
- Prompts ([Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide/blob/main/guides/README.md))

As highlighted [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluating-rag-applications-with-ragas-81d67b0ee31a):
> Building a proof of concept for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application is straightforward, but making it production-ready is challenging.

There's room for improvement, such as:
- Enhancing methods to segment episode scripts into documents.
- Substituting pronouns with names in documents to enhance context.
- Document embedding techniques.
- Leveraging vector store technology.
- Crafting more customized prompts tailored to the model utilized.
- Replacing the model hosted by LMStudio with an "inlined" Python model.
- Tweaking model parameters.
- Incorporating chat history.
- Refactoring project files to enable changes to the studied series.
